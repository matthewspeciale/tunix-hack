# Google's Tunix Hackathon on Kaggle
This was my team's submission to [Google's Tunix Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-tunix-hackathon) which ran from November 11, 2025 to January 12, 2026. 

The goal of the competition was to teach Gemma how to reason before it answers. 

The submission consisted of:
- a [notebook](hackathon-final.ipynb) that produced our fine-tuned model when run on a TPU v5e-8 on Kaggle (find our generated model [here](https://www.kaggle.com/models/sandeeplleb/tunix-gemma2-2b-grpo-final))
- a [write up](tunix-write-up.pdf) that explains our process
- a 3-minute overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ_LHMeszds)
