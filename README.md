# Google's Tunix Hackathon on Kaggle
This was my team's submission to [Google's Tunix Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-tunix-hackathon) which ran from November 11, 2025 to January 12, 2026. 

The goal of the competition was to teach Gemma how to reason before it answers. 

The submission consisted of a [notebook](hackathon-final.ipynb) that generates our model once run, a [write up](tunix-write-up.pdf) that explains our process and a 3-minute overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ_LHMeszds).
